# üìñ [YaYa Wallet Integration] <a name="about-project"></a>

My name is Esmael Mohammed, this project is for integration of yaya wallet API with my designed client website. as i requested for test project.

**[YaYa Wallet Integration]** A responsive website deisgn to integrate to yaya wallet api to manage transaction of the client.

### Application Architecture
have to applications, the frontend part: designed using angular 17 and the backend part: spring boot
#### Fronend Angular
- which allow clients/end users, to get all list of transactions, find thier own transaction by other user which send or recive the payment.

#### Backend Spring boot
- the backend part accept request ( find by user with the requested user or all my transaction), it build authorization signiture using HMAC sha 256 authorization method and send to the YaYa Api service. it accepts the response and then return to the client/frontend part.
- based on the specification of the YaYa Api serice documentation, i try to build the authorization header. but the API always respondes me "unauthorized" message. 
<br><br>
- My primary account, https://github.com/esmiz-dream, was unexpectedly suspended by GitHub; for that reason, I used an alternate account. There were works in the suspended account i built. I can show them if you need to see those projects.
